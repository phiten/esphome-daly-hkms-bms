# esphome-daly-hkms-bms
ESPHome component to monitor DALY H/K/M/S-Series Battery Management Systems via UART / RS485.  
Works with other of the "new" DALY BMS as well.

Tested with:
- 100A 15S K-Series BMS
- 100A 8S K-Series BMS
- 300A 8S K-Series BMS
- 500A 24S "100 Balance" Active Balance BMS

Also see https://github.com/syssi/esphome-daly-bms for a similar component that uses BLE.

## Configuration

### Main component
```yaml
daly_hkms_bms:
  - id: bms_1
    modbus_id: bms_modbus
    address: 1
    update_interval: 10s
```

There can be multiple BMS attached to one modbus. To make this work, each BMS needs its own address which can be set in the DALY BMS Tool (Administrator -> Password `12345678` -> Manufacturing -> Board number).

#### Options:
- **id**: ID of this component
- **modbus_id**: ID of the [modbus component](https://esphome.io/components/modbus.html) the BMS is attached to
- **address**: The address of the BMS. By default, this is set to 1. The address ("board number") can be set using the DALY PC software.
- **update_interval**: Delay between data requests (default `30s`)
- **update_interval_fast**:
    Delay between interjected "fast" data requests (includes only voltage and current, default: off).
    Be aware that fast requests always have priority, so if normal updates dont (always) work, this might be set too low.

## BMS connection
Be aware that by default, the BMS goes to sleep after 1 hour of inactivity and can not be woken up via RS485, only by RX/TX UART communication (including the Bluetooth dongle), charging/discharging the battery or toggling the switch input.

The BMS connectors are compatible with JST-GH (1.25mm pin pitch).

The BMS can be connected via UART or RS485. RS485 is less susceptible to interference and multiple BMS can be hooked up to one RS485 bus.

### UART

> [!WARNING]  
> The UART ground is always connected to the battery ground (not the BMS output ground)!  
> If the ESP is connected to the output side of the battery (through a DC-DC converter, GPIO, etc.) the ESP and/or BMS will be damaged once the BMS switches off!

Ideally, the ESP should be powered by the 3.3V on the BMS connector and not connected to anything else (unless opto-isolated).

#### ESP Connections
- tx_pin: BMS RX
- rx_pin: BMS TX
- GND: BMS GND

### RS485
In an RS485 bus, no pins are swapped between sender and receiver(s) (A -> A, B -> B, GND -> GND).

Also, the RS485 outputs of the BMS are isolated from the battery (at least on the K-series), so there are no ground issues like the UART pins have.

Still, always connect the ground when using RS485, to avoid stray currents running through the RS485 transceiver.

#### ESP Connections
- Transceiver without auto direction control (R, D, NRE, DE)
    - tx_pin: D
    - rx_pin: R
    - flow_control_pin: NRE, DE (tied together)
- Transceiver with auto direction control (RX, TX)
    - tx_pin: TX
    - rx_pin: RX
